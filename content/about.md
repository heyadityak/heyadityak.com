## Hello! 👋

I'm a passionate software engineer with a love for building elegant solutions to complex problems. With experience spanning from startups to enterprise environments, I've developed a deep understanding of what it takes to create software that scales.

## What I Do

I specialize in building cloud-native applications, designing robust APIs, and creating seamless developer experiences. My work focuses on:

- **Backend Development** - Building scalable, maintainable server-side applications
- **Cloud Infrastructure** - Designing and implementing cloud solutions on AWS
- **DevOps** - Automating deployments and maintaining CI/CD pipelines
- **Open Source** - Contributing to and maintaining open source projects

## My Approach

I believe in writing clean, well-tested code that stands the test of time. Every project I take on is an opportunity to learn something new and push the boundaries of what's possible.

When I'm not coding, you can find me exploring new technologies, writing technical blog posts, or contributing to the developer community.
